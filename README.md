# Pizza-sales-SQl-project
This project is based on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL Server (SSMS). The goal is to answer key business questions such as total revenue, top-selling pizzas, sales trends, and customer behavior. By writing SQL queries on tables like orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types, I generated insights that can help a  improve decision-making.

4. Identify the **peak order times (by hour of day)**.
5. Find the **average order value (AOV)**.
6. Monthly revenue trends.
7. Most profitable pizza size.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL Server (SSMS) → Querying and Analysis

 🚀 Future Improvements
